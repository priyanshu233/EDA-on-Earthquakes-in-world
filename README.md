# EDA-on-Earthquakes-in-world
# Overview
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of earthquake data. The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize earthquake occurrences to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can enhance our understanding of seismic activity.
Tech Stack used - python and its libraries
It is used to identify underlying patterns.


# Getting Started
To get started with the EDA, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone 
cd earthquake-eda
Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. Install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Explore the Data

Open the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to start exploring the data. You can use Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Navigate to the notebooks/ folder and open the notebooks.

# Dataset
The datasets contains various columns ->
time in millisecconds
place
status
tsunami (boolean value)
significance
data_type
magnitudo
state
longitude
latitude
depth
date

The dataset has been taken from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/code/priyanshu1235/eda-on-the-ultimate-earthquake-dataset).

In summary, the earthquakes dataset represents a fundamental information source for scientific research, public safety, and community awareness. By analyzing historical data and building predictive models, this dataset can significantly contribute to mitigating seismic risks and protecting people and infrastructure from the consequences of earthquakes.
